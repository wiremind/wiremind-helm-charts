# Karma

Karma is an ASL2 licensed alert dashboard for Prometheus Alertmanager.

## Introduction

This chart deploys karma to your cluster via a Deployment and Service.
Optionally you can also enable ingress.

# Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.9+

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`, run:

```bash
$ helm repo add wiremind https://wiremind.github.com/wiremind-helm-charts
$ helm install --name my-release wiremind/karma
```

After a few seconds, you should see service statuses being written to the configured output.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

The values.yaml lists the configurable parameters of the karma chart and their default values.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release \
    stable/karma
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml stable/karma
```

> **Tip**: You will have to define the URL to alertmanager in env-settings in [values.yaml](values.yaml), under key ALERTMANAGER_URI .
