## CRDs charts

To update CRDs of a specific chart, please refer to its README.md, if there is none, just copy paste the upstream CRDs into ours.

Then run this command:
```bash
MY_CHART="mycrdschartname"
find ./charts/$MY_CHART -type f -exec sed -i -e '/creationTimestamp: null/d' {} \;
```

Running this command is mandatory because of this:
> During the [upgrade to controller-tools@v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1054) for v1alpha2, we noticed a failure would occur running Cluster API test suite against the new CRDs, specifically `spec.metadata.creationTimestamp in body must be removed`. The investigation showed that `controller-tools@v2` behaves differently than its previous version when handling types from [metav1](k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1) package. \n In more details, we found that embedded (non-top level) types that embedded `metav1.ObjectMeta` had validation properties, including for `creationTimestamp` (metav1.Time). The `metav1.Time` type specifies a custom json marshaller that, when IsZero() is true, returns `null` which breaks validation because the field isn't marked as nullable. \n In future versions, controller-tools@v2 might allow overriding the type and validation for embedded types. When that happens, this hack should be revisited.
