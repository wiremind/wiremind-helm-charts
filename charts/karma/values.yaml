## Names of secrets that will be mounted to `/etc/certs/<secret_name>` in the karma container.
## These secrets can be used to configure TLS for Karma's Alertmanagers by passing their paths to
## the appropriate Karma configuration parameters. For example, secret `foo` containing a `ca.crt`
## will yield a file at `/etc/certs/foo/ca.crt`. That path can then be provided as the value to
# `configMap.rawConfig.alertmanager.servers[].tls.ca`.
