## Names of secrets that will be mounted to `/etc/certs/<secret_name>` in the karma container.
## These secrets can be used to configure TLS for Karma's Alertmanagers by passing their paths to
## the appropriate Karma configuration parameters. For example, secret `foo` containing a `ca.crt`
## will yield a file at `/etc/certs/foo/ca.crt`. That path can then be provided as the value to
# `configMap.rawConfig.alertmanager.servers[].tls.ca`.

## kthxbye is a tiny daemon that can help with managing short lived acknowledged silences.
## It will continuously extend short lived acknowledgement silences if there are alerts firing against those silences,
## which means that the user doesn't need to worry about setting proper duration for such silences.
