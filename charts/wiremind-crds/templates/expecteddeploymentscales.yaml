        The priority of the Deployment under control for scale down order.

        wiremind-kubernetes will, for each different priority found for all considered ExpectedDeploymentScale,
        scale down all deployments with a given priority, then wait for their pods to be actually deleted,
        then continue with the next priority (in descending order).

        Higher priority means that the Deployment will be scaled down before others with lower priority.
